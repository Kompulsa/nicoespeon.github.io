# Who am I?

My name is **Nicolas Carlo**. I'm a french student in an IT oriented business school in Paris.
Some people knows me as **espeon**, especially across the web where I use this nickname.

I'm also a freelance web-developer.

I know back-end development with PHP/MySQL and some Ruby on Rails. I played with some framework such as *CodeIgniter* or *Zend Framework 2*.
But **I enjoy front-end development the most**, keeping myself up-to-date with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I love building *Backbone.js* applications and improving my knowledge about front-end performance or CSS scalability (OOCSS, SMACSS, BEM, ... all of that kind of things).
