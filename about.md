# Who am I?

My name is **Nicolas Carlo**. I'm a french graduated of [Telecom Business School](http://telecom-em.eu), freelance developer & Agile coach aside.

I'm associate & Unit Production Manager at [Metidia](http://www.metidia.com).

To found a start-up requires you to do a lot of things, but I'm mostly responsible for:

- project management with an Agile mindset (Lean, Kanban) of a 4-6 persons team
- development of HTML5 games (Canvas, Backbone.js, Node.js, MongoDB)
- [Software Craftmanship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship) coaching and development of an Agile environment of production, adapted to the team (Management visuel, GitHub flow, CI…)

I essentially practice Node.js for the back-end part. I'm a **MongoDB certified** developer for having successfully completed the course *M101JS: MongoDB for Node.js Developers*.

I enjoy **front-end development** the most. I'm passionate with this whole domain, with particular specialization in these fields:

- development of [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application), notably with *Backbone.js*
- CSS scalability (OOCSS, SMACSS, BEM…)
- Software Craftmanship practices

I love to help teams setting up an **productive Agile environment** that fits their needs. I coach them to find together both organisational (visual management, Kanban, Kaizen, Lean methodology) and technical (CI environment, software craftmanship) solutions to blossom, produce faster and better.

Finally, I'm the co-organizer of the [Backbone.js Paris](http://www.meetup.com/backbone-paris/) meetup and [Best of Web Paris](http://bestofweb.paris/). I do talk there sometimes.
