# Who am I?

My name is **Nicolas Carlo**. I'm a french student in an IT oriented business school in Paris.
Some people knows me as **espeon**, especially across the web where I use this nickname.

I'm also a web-developer and project manager.

I joined a start-up called [Metidia](http://www.metidia.com) where I'm in charge of the technical part with [Fabien Bernard](http://twitter.com/fabien0102).

I know back-end development with Node.js, PHP/MySQL and some Ruby on Rails. I played with some framework such as *CodeIgniter* or *Zend Framework 2*. I'm also a **MongoDB certified** developer for successful completed the course *M101JS: MongoDB for Node.js Developers*.
But **I enjoy front-end development the most**, keeping myself up-to-date with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I love building *Backbone.js* applications and improving my knowledge about front-end performance or CSS scalability (OOCSS, SMACSS, BEM, ... all of that kind of things).
