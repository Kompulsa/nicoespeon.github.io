This is an english one to test how it goes.

In fact, it doesn't look that bad, does it?

## Some code before going on

{% highlight js linenos %}
$(function() {
    // your code here...
})
{% endhighlight %}

Here was an example of *javascript* code, but you can have it inline like `$(function() { ... }` right?
